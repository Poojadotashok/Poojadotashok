- Spam Detection System Using Hadoop and Hive
  In this project, we developed a spam detection system leveraging Hadoop and Hive on AWS. The system processed a large dataset of Amazon product reviews, classifying emails as spam or ham based on text analysis. We used Hive to clean and filter data, applying rules to identify spam keywords and calculate TF-IDF scores for feature extraction. The system was built on an EMR cluster and optimized for large-scale data processing, utilizing MapReduce for keyword extraction and classification. This project demonstrated effective use of cloud-based distributed systems for handling big data​.

- Examining Feature Engineering Techniques with Application in the Forex Market
  This project focused on improving predictive accuracy in the Forex market through advanced feature engineering techniques. By combining technical analysis (e.g., candlestick patterns) with fundamental analysis (economic events), I developed models that demonstrated a notable improvement in forecasting performance. The final models showed increased precision in predicting market trends, leading to more effective trading strategies. The project was implemented using Python, scikit-learn, and Jupyter notebooks, with GitLab for version control and cloud deployment, ensuring a scalable and collaborative workflow.
